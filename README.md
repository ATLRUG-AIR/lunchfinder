# LunchFinder
Spontaneous lunch spot finder based on user location

## Description:
This app is for anyone who's ever been out with indecisive friends that can't figure out where to eat. With the push of a button, the app should get your location, pick a local spot to eat, and display information about it. 

For inspiration, look at [LunchFinder](http://lunchfinder.herokuapp.com)

## Basic Requirements: 
* User can see a short list of the top 5 lunch locations near them
* User shouldn't have to enter their location
* User can see relevant metadata for each location, including name, address, and phone number
* Get it live on Heroku!

## Optional Requirements:
*  Allow user to specify a max walking distance. You'll have to make some assumptions about how fast a human can walk
*  Only display locations that are currently open 
*  Make it look nicer!

## Anti-Requirements:
This is meant to be a short beginner exercise. DO NOT do the following.
* Try to make a single page app
* Use any Javascript framework, except for jQuery and/or underscore
* Authenticate users

## Suggested Technologies:
* Sinatra
* Google Maps API or Yelp API
* HTML5 Geolocation
