# LunchFinder
Spontaneous lunch spot finder based on user location

## Description:
This app is for anyone who's ever been out with indecisive friends that can't figure out where to eat. With the push of a button, the app should get your location, pick a local spot to eat, and display information about it. 

For inspiration, look at [LunchFinder](http://lunchfinder.herokuapp.com)

Create a Twilio based tool where someone can call in, enter a 5 digit code, and record a short message. Then anyone else can call into that same number, enter the same code, and listen to the messages left in reverse chronological order. They can then also leave their own message that others can hear. This is inspired by a very funny This American Life story. 

## Basic Requirements: 
* User enters a 5 digit code to channel into a thread and hears the messages on that thread in reverse order
* User can enter the number 1 at any time to add their own message

## Suggested Technologies:
* Sinatra
* Google Maps API or Yelp API
* HTML5 Geolocation
